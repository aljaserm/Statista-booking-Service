**Prerequisites**

- JDK 21
- IntelliJ (recommended) or your favorite Java IDE
- Recommended: Bash environment with installed 'curl' or Postman for testing

**Preamble**
     
Your mission would you decide to accept it:

As part of the multi-disciplinary development elite team **PIT** in Statista you are creating software to alleviate the 
issues from our Sales team. For this, a new requirement has been raised to implement a RESTful web service that stores 
_booking_ objects in memory and return information about them.

Note: A _booking_ is a request from any of our beloved customers to acquire one of our products. 

**Challenge**

The module **code-challenge** already contains the basic structure of a Spring Boot application for you.

The bookings to be stored have the following fields:
 - booking_id
 - description
 - price
 - currency
 - subscription_start_date
 - email
 - department

Please define as many departments as you will like, and create a unique method `doBusiness()` for each department. This 
is your time to shine, so the method implementations can be as simple, elegant, or complicated as you want. 

Feel free to select the best data type that, in your opinion, would define those fields the best.

You should not use a database or some other sort of persistence but come up with an own data structure to store the 
transactions.

In any moment where the implementation implies the usage of an external server (i.e. sending e-mail's) feel free to mock
creatively these external resources, keeping in mind that all real-world use-cases must be covered.

In general, we are looking for a good implementation, code quality, code resilience, code extensibility, code 
maintainability and how the implementation is tested.
Basically something you wouldn't be too embarrassed to push to production.
